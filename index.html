			<p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
				In developed countries, chickens are usually subject to intensive 
				farming methods. Chicken meat contains about two to three times as 
				much polyunsaturated fat than most types of red meat when measured 
				as weight percentage. Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat 
				itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated 
				on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams 
				of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 
				grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
